            <h3>About Our Bakery</h3>
            <p>Joe opened his restaurant back in 1963. The original location was a few blocks away from the current one
                and was located in the basement of a bar/bowling alley.
                "Joe's Place" was the original name. He not only sold pizzas at the time, but he also sold donuts.
                When the pizza shop relocated to its current downtown location in 1970, a few changes occurred within
                the main business.
                Joe first changed the name of the business to Joe's Pizza and stopped selling donuts because pizzas were
                flying off the shelves.
